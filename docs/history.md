# The Fall of Constantinople (1453)

The Fall of Constantinople was a historic event that marked the end of the Byzantine Empire.
On May 29, 1453, Ottoman forces, led by Sultan Mehmed II, captured the city after a prolonged siege.

Constantinople was regarded as one of the most fortified cities of its time. Its great defensive walls
had withstood attacks for more than a thousand years. However, advancements in military technology,
especially the use of large cannons, played a crucial role in the final siege.

The fall of the city had far-reaching consequences. It shifted the balance of power, strengthened
the Ottoman Empire, and pushed European nations to seek new trade routes to the East, contributing
to the Age of Exploration.
