# The Life Cycle of Stars

Stars are born in massive clouds of dust and gas known as nebulae. Under the influence of gravity,
these clouds collapse and begin nuclear fusion, forming a new star. The majority of a star's life
is spent in the main sequence phase, where hydrogen is fused into helium.

Massive stars burn their fuel quickly and can end their life in spectacular explosions called supernovae.
These explosions release immense energy and scatter heavy elements across the universe, contributing
to the formation of planets and even life.

Smaller stars, like our Sun, end their life more quietly. After exhausting their hydrogen fuel,
they expand into red giants and eventually shed their outer layers, leaving behind a white dwarf.

Understanding the life cycle of stars helps astronomers study the evolution of galaxies and
the chemical enrichment of the cosmos.
