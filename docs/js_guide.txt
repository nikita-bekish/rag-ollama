JavaScript Closures Explained

A closure in JavaScript is a function that remembers its outer variables even when executed outside 
their original scope. Closures allow functions to access data that was available at the time of creation.

Example:

function createCounter() {
    let count = 0;
    return function () {
        count++;
        return count;
    };
}

const counter = createCounter();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2

Closures are powerful tools in JavaScript. They are used for data privacy, event handlers, 
functional programming patterns, and asynchronous logic.

Another example of closure usage is configuration functions, where the first function stores settings 
and the second function performs logic based on them.
